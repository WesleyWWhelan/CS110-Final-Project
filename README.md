# CS110-Final-Project

This is my final project for Spring semester at Minerva CS110: Solving Problems with Algorithms.

This notebook shows an object-oriented approach to algorithmically finding the best fit song for a user trying to learn guitar. Using skill levels on a variety of attributes related to guitar, we find which songs in our song list match the criteria for the user to learn. The user inputs a skill they want to practice and the algorithm finds a song in the list of songs that fits the criteria.
