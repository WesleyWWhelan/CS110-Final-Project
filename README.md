# CS110-Final-Project

This is my final project for Spring semester at Minerva CS110: Solving Problems with Algorithms.

This notebook shows an object-oriented approach to algorithmically finding the best fit song for a user trying to learn guitar. Using skill levels on a variety of attributes related to guitar, we find which songs in our song list match the criteria for the user to learn. The user inputs a skill they want to practice and the algorithm finds a song in the list of songs that fits the criteria.
There are additional functionalities that have not been fully explored, and multiple additions that have yet to be written in stone. I would like to add genre based sorting, caps on difficulty levels for selected skills, as well as optimization of non-selected skills to maximize learning.
